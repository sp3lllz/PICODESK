# PICODESK

Hello,

This is my open source hardware and software project to add memory function to IKEA motorised sit stand desks using the Resperry Pi Pico W

WARNING! Doing this modification requires breaking open the opriginal controller in order to connect my board to the orgiginal doing this risks damaging your desk (I blew up a powersupply for the desk in protoyping this) and there is risk of personal injury. I bare no responsibility if this happens to you please do this modification at your own risk and always verify any hardware or software you use from this project before using them yourself.
